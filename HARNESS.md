# Socratink TUI Harness

This document maps the TUI’s **SEDA** (staged event-driven) loop to closed-loop harness
ideas used in substrates like [Moss Harness](https://github.com/cybernetix-lab/moss-harness).
It is the substrate contract; product pedagogy lives in `AGENTS.md` and
`pedagogical_agents/contracts.json`. For the V-model decomposition ↔ verification
map (what to gate at each tier), see [`HARNESS-TRACEABILITY.md`](HARNESS-TRACEABILITY.md).

## Recursive V-model for agent work

Use a recursive V-model for all non-trivial changes. Decompose from intent to requirements, design, and implementation; then climb back through verification, integration, validation, and operational feedback.

Every artifact should have a proof counterpart:
- requirement → test, eval, or acceptance criterion
- design decision → architectural rationale or ADR
- implementation → unit/integration/e2e evidence
- user-facing behavior → validation against the original intent

A task is not done when code is written. It is done when the change is verified against its specification, validated against its intended use, and traceable from goal to evidence.

When evidence fails, route the correction to the right abstraction level. Implementation failure means repair code. Integration failure means inspect boundaries and interfaces. Validation failure means revisit assumptions, requirements, or user intent. Repeated failures should produce a durable rule, test, or doc update.



## Layers

| Layer | Responsibility | Artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Strategy** | Graph honesty, phase catalog, canon boundaries | `AGENTS.md`, `pedagogical_agents/contracts.json`, prompt versions in `prompt_templates.py` |
| **Substrate** | Orchestration, event log, routing, bridge calls | `app.mjs` (`HANDLERS`), `lib/seda/run-loop.mjs`, `lib/seda/next-phase.mjs`, `lib/seda/handlers/`, `lib/bridge/client.mjs`, `lib/bridge/registry.json`, `bridge.py` |
| **App** | Founder-facing session UX | `./socratink-tui`, scripted fixtures under `fixtures/` |
| **Observability** | Read-only truth over runs | `session.json`, `./socratink-harness replay`, `./socratink-dashboard`, `DOGFOODING.md` |

The interactive TUI is an **app** on the harness. Do not treat UI copy or LLM prose as
the source of routing truth.

## Architectural invariants

These are non-negotiable for changes to the loop:

1. **Append-only facts** — `events[]` is never mutated in place. Routing reads the log;
   handlers append one or more events per turn.
2. **Orchestrator owns control flow** — `nextPhase(events)` in `lib/seda/next-phase.mjs`
   is pure (no bridge, handlers, or I/O). Handlers must not pick the next phase except
   via emitted events. Even skipping the post-bridge transfer check emits a
   `post_bridge_transfer_skipped` fact that the controller routes to spacing — there is
   no off-log phase override.
3. **Feedback reroutes** — Evaluator/bridge fields on events (`classification`,
   `bridge_ready`, `next_dialogue_action`, …) are **control signals**, not display-only.
4. **Derivation owns graph truth** — Evaluator labels are inputs; `training-derive` owns
   `solidified` / `primed`. The UI must explain holds when they disagree.
5. **Observability is read-only** — Replay and dashboard consume `session.json`; they do
   not rewrite events or derived state.

Moss’s **Fact → Audit → Broadcast** maps here as:

```text
Handler turn  →  append event(s)     (fact)
              →  derive training      (audit / policy view)
              →  write session.json   (broadcast to operators)
              →  nextPhase(events)    (orchestrator)
```

## The closed loop

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  while (phase) {                                              │
│    HANDLERS[phase](ctx)  →  events.push(...)   // lane work    │
│    phase = nextPhase(events)                 // orchestrator   │
│  }                                                            │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ▲                              │
         │         bridge.py            │
         └──── evaluate / repair / route ┘
                    (typed feedback)
```

**Phases** (handlers): `idle`, `ignition`, `substrate_gate`, `route`, `cold_attempt`,
`strong_cold_path`, `delta`, `repair_dialogue`, `repair_recovery`,
`repair_abandoned`, `repair`, `model_bridge`, `post_bridge_transfer`, `spacing`,
`spaced_redrill`.

**Facts** (events): see `DIRECT_PHASE` and special branches in `nextPhase()` in `lib/seda/next-phase.mjs`.

## Two-stage routing

Moss uses coarse intent + fine policy. The TUI uses the same shape:

| Stage | Mechanism | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Coarse** | `DIRECT_PHASE[last.type]` | `route_generated` → `cold_attempt` |
| **Fine** | Policy on fields of `last` | `cold_attempt` + `classification === "solid"` → `strong_cold_path`, else `delta` |
| **Fine** | Repair dialogue policy | `bridge_ready` → `repair`; cap / `abandon` → `repair_abandoned` |

`nextPhase` must stay the **only** router. Resist embedding “if solid, go to spacing” inside
handlers without emitting an event that `nextPhase` understands.

## Control vocabulary (Moss ↔ Socratink)

| Moss governance | Socratink behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **proceed** | Next phase in `DIRECT_PHASE` or happy-path policy branch |
| **rework** | `delta`, extra `repair_dialogue_turn`, route retry (`route_retry`), recovery path |
| **circuit-break** | `repair_abandoned`, `cold_support_exhausted`, `idle_exit`, turn caps |

## Event roles

| Role | Meaning | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Routing facts** | Drive `nextPhase` via type + payload | `cold_attempt`, `repair_dialogue_turn`, `strong_cold_path` |
| **Graph-neutral** | Telemetry / routing only; no evidence mutation | `cold_help_turn`, `repair_dialogue_turn`, `post_bridge_transfer_check`, recovery events — see `AGENTS.md` |
| **Evidence candidates** | Learner text that may affect derivation | `cold_attempt` (scored), `repair`, `spaced_redrill` |
| **Context** | Not evidence | source, goal, route, scaffolds, `/help`, `/hint` |

## Moss ↔ Socratink map

| Moss concept | Socratink TUI |
| --- | --- |
| Role lanes | Phase handlers (`HANDLERS`) — pedagogical lanes, not dev roles |
| Workflow orchestrator | `nextPhase(events)` |
| Transactional fact chain | Append-only `events[]` in `session.json` |
| Reviewer / Evaluator | `bridge.py`: `evaluate-attempt`, `repair-dialogue`, `repair-scaffold` |
| Task governance (proceed / rework / stop) | Classification, `bridge_ready`, `next_dialogue_action`, caps |
| Validation app | Scripted fixtures + `SOCRATINK_TUI_FAKE_LLM` |
| Read-only observability | `socratink-harness replay`, `socratink-dashboard --json` |
| `moss_*` metrics (target) | `tui_*` counters from replay cases (rework, abandon, strong-cold rate) — optional future |

**Not ported from Moss** (by design): six dev-agent lanes, task-board claiming, expert
evolution, K8s operator, MCP skill registry. Cross-run memory curation is limited to
promoted traces in `learning_cases/`.

## Observability surfaces

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SOCRATINK_TUI_LOG_ROOT/<ts>/session.json` | Full fact chain, `derived`, `llm_calls`, `product_loop` |
| `./socratink-harness replay` | Assert `expected_invariants` on promoted cases (`learning_cases/cases.jsonl`) |
| `./socratink-harness routing-proof` | Verify `nextPhase` routes each promoted trace (`lib/seda/routing-proofs.mjs`) |
| `./socratink-dashboard --json` | Founder summaries for dogfooding |
| `DOGFOODING.md` | Closed loop: replay → dashboard → triage JSON |

Replay checks include `event_order`, `final_node_state`, forbidden events/stages, and
evaluator vs derivation alignment (`truth_source: training_derivation`).

## Traversal and map layers

Three layers must stay separate in product copy and routing:

| Layer | Artifact | Learner-facing rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hypothesis | `route.provisional_map` + `map_displayed` | Thesis and backbone **orient** only. Mechanisms stay hidden until model bridge. |
| Evidence | `events[]`, training attempts | Only generative, score-eligible attempts count. Graph-neutral phases do not mutate truth. |
| Graph truth | `derived` from `training-derive` | `solidified` requires spaced strong reconstruction; evaluator `solid` ≠ solidified. |

Traversal rules (dungeon crawl intent, current TUI scope):

1. **Orient** after route: show thesis, backbone pillars, and room list with one **active** subnode (`map_displayed` in `session.json`).
2. **Enter** at the active subnode (`first_node`), not at thesis or backbone as scored tasks.
3. **Advance rooms** along `learning_prerequisites` when multi-node crawl ships — never along `backbone[]` array order or lecture order.
4. **Clear** a room on derivation, not on evaluator labels or model-bridge reveal.
5. **Interleave** at spaced re-drill, not as immediate hops to adjacent rooms after repair.

Over-decomposed subnodes are **fake dungeon rooms** (see `learnops-extract/extract-system-v1.txt`).

## Graph completion (session vs KC)

Two different “done” signals — do not conflate them in copy or dashboard triage:

| Signal | Meaning | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Session complete** | Learner ran the product loop to `idle` (often after `spaced_redrill`) | `events[]` ends with `idle_exit` or idle after spacing |
| **Bridge gate passed** | Own-words repair satisfied `bridge_ready`; model bridge may reveal | Last `repair_dialogue_turn.bridge_ready === true` |
| **KC complete (graph truth)** | Node derived to **`solidified`** | `training-derive.js` on `node_records[].attempts[]` |

**Derivation gate** (`lib/canon/training-derive.js`):

1. Only **`cold_attempt`** and **`spaced_redrill`** call `store.appendAttempt` (evidence candidates).
2. Evaluator **`solid`** maps to store **`strong`** (`classifyForStore` in `cold-gating.mjs`).
3. **`solidified`** requires **two** `strong` attempts **≥ 18h apart** (`SPACING_INTERVAL_MS`).

**Typical paths:**

```text
Strong cold (one session can solidify):
  cold solid → strong #1 → primed → strong_cold_path → spacing → spaced solid → strong #2 → solidified

Repair path (session complete ≠ solidified):
  cold shallow → partial → delta → repair_dialogue → bridge_ready → model bridge
  → spacing → spaced solid → strong #1 only → primed (+ evidence_hold if UI explains)
  → second strong spaced later (/redrill) → solidified
```

Replay enforces `final_node_state` and `evidence_hold_required` on promoted cases.
The UI must explain holds when evaluator `solid` disagrees with derived state
(`lib/seda/evidence-hold.mjs`).

## Worked example: Moss-style timeline

Case: `inner-repair-dialogue-gates-model-bridge-2026-05-26` (see
`learning_cases/traces/inner-repair-dialogue-gates-model-bridge-2026-05-26/session.json`).

Fixture driver: `fixtures/source_less_script.json` (with `repair_dialogue_turns` in fuller
fixtures; trace captured from live/fake run).

```text
PHASE (lane)          FACT (event)                    FEEDBACK → ROUTE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ignition              launch_attempt                  proceed → substrate_gate
substrate_gate        substrate_confirmed             proceed → route
route                 route_generated                 proceed → cold_attempt
cold_attempt          cold_attempt                    classification ≠ solid → delta
delta                 gap_identified                  proceed → repair_dialogue
repair_dialogue       repair_dialogue_turn (×2)       bridge_ready false → rework (stay)
repair_dialogue       repair_dialogue_turn            bridge_ready true → repair
repair                repair                          proceed → model_bridge
model_bridge          model_bridge                    proceed → post_bridge_transfer
post_bridge_transfer  post_bridge_transfer_check      graph-neutral → spacing
spacing               spacing_advanced                proceed → spaced_redrill
spaced_redrill        spaced_redrill                  eval solid; derive may hold primed
```

**Harness lesson:** two graph-neutral dialogue turns are **rework**; only the
bridge-ready turn authorizes `repair` and thus `model_bridge`. Evaluator “solid” on spaced
redrill does not override derivation — replay enforces `evidence_hold_required` on this case.

## Scripted smoke (validation app)

```bash
SOCRATINK_TUI_FAKE_LLM=1 \
SOCRATINK_TUI_FAKE_COLD_CLASSIFICATION=shallow \
./socratink-tui --scripted fixtures/source_less_script.json --color=never

./socratink-harness replay
```

## Changing the harness

1. Emit a new or extended **event** (fact) from the handler.
2. Teach **coarse** routing in `DIRECT_PHASE` if `last.type` alone suffices.
3. Teach **fine** policy in `nextPhase` if fields on `last` decide the branch.
4. Add a **handler** only when a new phase needs distinct UX/work.
5. Bump prompt template version if bridge slots change; run `pytest tests/test_prompt_template.py`.
6. Promote a trace: `learning_cases/cases.jsonl` + `expected_invariants` + replay green.

See `AGENTS.md` for graph-honesty rules and fixture format.

## Bridge function catalog

Wire contracts for the five `bridge.py` actions (template version, I/O schema, emitted
events, routing fields read by `nextPhase`): [`HARNESS-BRIDGE-REGISTRY.md`](HARNESS-BRIDGE-REGISTRY.md).
Machine-readable: `lib/bridge/registry.json`. Summary table is generated from
`registry.json` via `node scripts/refresh-bridge-registry-doc.mjs`.
